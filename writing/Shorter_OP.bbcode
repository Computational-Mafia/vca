Anyone who's played enough Mafia has some hunches about how town and scum differ in how they use their votes. Some of those might be right and others might be wrong! Here let's subject all these ideas to some scrutiny.

After a bit of work, I have my hands on a dataset tracking every vote anyone's ever made across hundreds of completed non-theme games. I've got each vote's post number, target, and maker, whatever. I even know which day phase they happened. And for each game in the data set, I also hypothetically have all the stuff you usually see in a mod's OP - stuff like who won, each slot's role/alliance/fate, replacements, etcetera. I also of course have every one of each game's posts. And in a sense, [url=https://github.com/Computational-Mafia/vca] so do you[/url] -- though I could still do much more work to make all this more accessible.

In my posts below I'll provide further details about my work on and plans for the project and so on but above all I'm interested in you and your ideas and connecting them to data. Pass on your ideas and there's a solid chance me or someone else can do some work on them. Here are starter questions I'd welcome anyone to provide input on:

[list]
[*] What are some memorable ways people's votes have lately pinged you as suspicious (or the opposite!)?
[*] What are your most confident beliefs about how town and mafia tend use their votes?
[*] What are some things you always wondered about how players vote but could never confirm?
[*] Do you have an approach to vote count analysis that you apply in your games, even a vague one?
[*] How do matters like WIFOM or the context of votes color your interpretation of them? 
[/list]

If you're particularly code or stats-savvy or just feeling creative, I'd also appreciate any advice (or of course contributions) in that space for making the most of all this. And from me, you can expect a steady flow of new plots and analyses, and eventually models and tools, focused on growing and turning this dataset into usable knowledge about how people play this game.
