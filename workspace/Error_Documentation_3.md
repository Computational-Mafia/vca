## Notes

### Big Problem
#### 1227 // 18910
Processing: killer
No match attained.
{'don_johnson': 11, 'killerX029': 4, 'themarshall': 10, 'Grimmjow': 7, 'saulres': 5, 'Garuru': 6, 'Supreme Overlord': 14, 'Beck': 6, 'Applefarmer': 8, 'charter': 5, 'Parama': 6, 'Verity': 6, 'Whiskers': 5, 'David Xanatos': 12, 'killerjester': 6, 'Protoplasm': 9, 'Zdenek': 5, 'Hayker': 4}
Minimum LevDistance Player: killerX029 4
Final Result Code 19
[('UNVOTE', 0)]

This is clearly not acceptable. But the straightforward option isn't really preferred here. I mean, there are multiple usernames starting with killer here. The two are around at different times, but I don't have an easy way to detect that. I guess I should try?

By considering post order, I can at least improve specificity to the level of the Day phase. But then again, people will often vote for expired usernames. Tough one. Anyway, this game is cursed and I need a way to flag games like them.

#### 1207 //18412
Processing depth for the match was 37, meaning I ditched the "lolwagons" and only one username had the characters "no" in it. A pretty dubious match that I might try to curtail with a minimum character limit or other constraint. Could that have downsides? Depends on how I do it.

### 1407 // 24645
Another really niche initial detection fail. 

### 1361 // 22900
Again an issue with the initial parser rather than the voteextractor. Hopefully a niche one; I don't know of people saying vigvote a lot.

### 1456 // 28649
The ampersand's equivalance to the word "and" is what tripped me up here. I could easily add, but how many votes would it address?

### 1517 // 33249
I could similarly account for the edge case where someone breaks quote tags if I wanted to, but its impact wouldn't be substantial.

### 1544 // 37632
A clear case of the votecounter being overeager, but at least it's pretty niche.

### 1560 // 41311
Another concrete example of users with similar usernames existing at different times in a thread, making votes ambiguous when they don't need to be. It might be worth addressing this issue given that it's now frequent.

### 1662 // 61419
Preserved example of failure due to vote pre-amble within formatting tags that resolves before vote detection.

### 1687 // 62181
The votecounter should be able to handle this one by use of englishdivides, but here it fails. Tough.

Initially identified votes:  ['DullBellcows']

Processing: DullBellcows
No match attained.
{'Persivul': 11, 'Mathdino': 11, 'toolenduso': 10, 'RadiantCowbells': 12, 'Tere': 11, 'CB': 11, 'Bellaphant': 10, 'Cthulhu Dreaming': 14, 'Thor665': 12, 'Shinobi': 11, 'texcat': 10, 'Fro99er': 11, 'Lapsa': 11, 'Zoronos': 10}
Minimum LevDistance Player: toolenduso 10
Final Result Code 19

#### 1705 // 62909
Tool still isn't rejecting under ambiguity as much as I'd like.

#### 1720 // 63443
I could probably get these two with the distance rule if I relaxed it, but I just don't think it's worth it without strong controls.

#### 1735 // 64070
Pretty unacceptable, I think. There has to be a systematic error in my votecounter for this to happen.

Let's check the ricastle vote...
Initially identified votes:  ['rikky6']
Processing: rikky6
No match attained.
{'BlockyMan': 7, 'KarmicGuide': 9, 'RadiantCowbells': 13, 'Klingoncelt': 10, 'pignash': 6, 'Dierfire': 7, 'Smudger': 7, 'Ricastle': 6, 'Frozen Angel': 11, 'EspeciallyTheLies': 15, 'ceasor': 6, 'TheCow': 6, 'pisskop': 5}
Minimum LevDistance Player: pisskop 5
Final Result Code 19
[]

And the cow votes...
Initially identified votes:  ['Cow']

Processing: Cow
[('ceasor', 10)]
'ces' has a levenstein distance <=2  from "cow" I guess. That's dubious as fuck.

#### 1836 // 68519
Most of the time I fail to follow an abbreviation it's because I just don't factor in how abbreviations can just be the initial letters.

Initially identified votes:  ['xf']

Processing: xf
[('TwoFace', 15)]

Somehow obvious and difficult.

#### 1921 // 72324
Initially identified votes:  ['pjm']

Processing: pjm
[('pamda', 17)]

Even more obvious but also somewhat difficult to address seamlessly.

#### 1923 // 72397
Initially identified votes:  ['teebs']

Processing: teebs
[('Assemblerotws', 20)]
> if every char in vote is char in just one playername

### Probably Impossible Without Direct Help
#### 1094 // 15783
Think I can't resolve this with some principled algorithm; need alias management to resolve this issue reliably. Closest username is actually Rhinox, with a distance of 6. Other usernames like morthrax are also as close or closer than Reckamonic.

#### 1177 // 17606
Nothing I can do about it.

### 1390 // 23772
Again another error requiring lots of context to detect. I shouldn't feel bad for the votecounter failing here.

#### 1569 // 48071
#### 1655 // 61070
#### 1701 // 62781

#### 1866 // 69859
First isn't something my votecounter can handle with my current approach but I also shouldn't be assigning this vote to anyone; I may want to limit processing depth further.

Second is also probably outside the votecounter's range; "Mandy" doesn't correspond to the username matched.
Initially identified votes:  ['Mandy']

Processing: Mandy
No match attained.

### Mod Difference

#### 1317 // 21340
#### 1440 // 27042
#### 1505 // 31972
#### 1589 // 58383

### Ambiguous
### 1234 // 18952
Pretty bizzare; I think I'm safe just labeling these and assuming they never happen anywhere else.

### Scratch

To process this vote without matching to bellaphant, we need to not check for substrings for short vote chars.

Initially identified votes:  ['ha']

Processing: ha
[('heuristically_alone', 14)]

But this makes it hard to match "ac" to ac1983fan. Why?
