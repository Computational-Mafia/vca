    "# Final Position on Wagon\n",
    "Our initial analysis will focus on characterizing variation in the position of players on final wagons as a function of factors like their slot's faction, the current game phase, the number of players required to secure an elimination, etc. Here we hope to demo the main visual constructs that will be featured in other initial analyses."
