STILL HAVE 7 LEFT.

## Offhand
Refreshed to ensure I consider all changes to tool output.

### 1094 // 15783
Think I can't resolve this with some principled algorithm; need alias management to resolve this issue reliably. Closest username is actually Rhinox, with a distance of 6. Other usernames like morthrax are also as close or closer than Reckamonic. 

### 1133 // 16769
Preserved from last pass. This is a failure of the vote detector rather than the vote extractor; no votes are initially identified. Current hypothesis is that I'm not handling votes that start too late after tag initiated. This could be the right policy most of the time.

### 1140 // 16852
Same sort of failure of the vote detector rather than the vote extractor; no votes are initially identified. Maintained hypothesis is that I'm not handling votes that start too late after tag initiated.

### 1157 // 17276
There's no accounting for direct contradictions in moderator policy. My votecounter has to go for the most common policy and I have to manually tack discrepancies.

### 1177 // 17606
Two initial errors! The first is unavoidable for the votecounter since it only considers one post at a time. The latter I seem to only have gotten right by accident. Moderator probably rejected on basis of tags; I rejected on basis of low similarity. Distance is 7. Closest alternative is 9, though, so this is a bit different from my other 7. Oddly, taking this into account would have made a new error! Still, at least the error is properly characterized.

### 1207 // 18412
Processing depth for the match was 37, meaning I ditched the "lolwagons" and only one username had the characters "no" in it. A pretty dubious match that I might try to curtail with a minimum character limit or other constraint. Could that have downsides? Depends on how I do it.

### 1227 // 18910
Processing: killer
No match attained.

Minimum LevDistance Player: killerX029 4
Final Result Code 19
[('UNVOTE', 0)]

This is clearly not acceptable. But the straightforward option isn't really preferred here. I mean, there are multiple usernames starting with killer here. The two are around at different times, but I don't have an easy way to detect that. I guess I should try?

By considering post order, I can at least improve specificity to the level of the Day phase. But then again, people will often vote for expired usernames. Tough one. Anyway, this game is cursed and I need a way to flag games like them.

### 1234 // 18952
Pretty bizzare; I think I'm safe just labeling these and assuming they never happen anywhere else.

### 1341 // 22206
Initially identified votes:  [', thanks.']

Processing: , thanks.
No match attained.

[]

For some reason, everything between vote and the final word was discarded. Still some core issues with my initial vote detector.

### 1361 // 22900
Again an issue with the initial parser rather than the voteextractor. Hopefully a niche one; I don't know of people saying vigvote a lot.

### 1390 // 23772
Again another error requiring lots of context to detect. I shouldn't feel bad for the votecounter failing here.

### 1407 // 24645
Another really niche initial detection fail. 

### 1456 // 28649
The ampersand's equivalance to the word "and" is what tripped me up here. I could easily add, but how many votes would it address?

### 1517 // 33249
I could similarly account for the edgec case where someone breaks quote tags if I wanted to, but its impact wouldn't be substantial.

### 1544 // 37632
A clear case of the votecounter being overeager, but at least it's pretty niche.

### 1556 // 39665
Single letter usernames like N's potentially mess up a lot of my flow; I should watch out for that.

### 1560 // 41311
Another concrete example of users with similar usernames existing at different times in a thread, making votes ambiguous when they don't need to be. It might be worth addressing this issue given that it's now frequent.

### 1662 // 61419
Another example of failure due to vote pre-amble within formatting tags that resolves before vote detection.

### 1687 // 62181
The votecounter should be able to handle this one by use of englishdivides, but here it fails.

### 1720 // 63443
I could probably get this with the distance rule if I relaxed it, but I just don't think it's worth it.

### 1735 // 64070
Pretty unacceptable, I think. There has to be a systematic error in my votecounter for this to happen.

### 1747 // 64581
Initially identified votes:  ['Chaotic Neutrality']

Processing: Chaotic Neutrality
[('NO LYNCH', 0)]

NOPE. I currently automatically label any vote containing the letters of "nolynch" as a vote for that.

### 1752 // 64784
There are still big issues with how I handle abbreviations and short names.

### 1782 // 65928
Initially identified votes:  ['heuristically_alone']

Processing: heuristically_alone
[('NO LYNCH', 0)]

### 1787 // 66258
heuristically_alone is in this game too

### 1782 // 65928
heuristically_alone

### 1805 // 67069
Another failure to detect the vote after the leading tag

### 1836 // 68519
Most of the time I fail to follow an abbreviation it's because I just don't factor in how abbreviations can just be the initial letters.

### 1848 // 68980
In general I need to be more severe with my comparisons for shorter strings; otherwise they can get in the way of my flow for anticipating abbreviations of longer ones. I might even prefer to have separate tracks

### 1195 // 17864
If ICEninja were a normally demarcated pair of words I don't think I'd have this issue. Processing depth was 37, meaning "Magic Trainer" was the one user name where "every char in vote is char in just one playername". The space character gave the latter an advantage. That seems unintended. But on the other hand, it might be fine in other situations. Would have to test. In this case, performing step 18 without including space characters resolves the vote for ICEninja at depth 41. This is kind of odd since "ice" has no capitalizations in it and that's what the third test is for - ah, the comparison happens to lowercases but I extract the capitalizations from the original. Hmm.

Before this modification, the measured rates were...
Vote Success Rate: 0.9615931721194879, Transition Success Rate: 0.9352773826458037. 
How about now? It's slightly, barely noticeably higher. Okay!

### 1199 // 17940
Lots of issues.

Swiftstrike is not voting according to my votecounter, but L-1s malpascp in the official reading. Even though minimum levenshtein distance matches to malp, my existing matchers don't, so the detected vote goes unmatched. The levenshtein distance in this case is just 3, so it feels like a waste. I wonder what it is in the other cases?

Smallpeople343 is voting Empking according to my votecounter, but hammers malpascp in the official reading. Same use of "Malps" messes things up here.

{'SomeRandomGuy': 11, 'Internet Stranger': 16, 'yabbaguy': 7, 'BeautyUndead': 11, 'PeregrineV': 10, 'David Xanatos': 11, 'FightingShadow': 13, 'Ant_to_the_Max': 14, 'Rikana': 6, 'JAMFTW': 5, 'Swiftstrike': 10, 'malpascp': 3, 'Locke Lamora': 11, 'smallpeoples343': 10, 'bristep123': 9, 'Empking': 6, 'Sky': 5}

Furthermore, SomeRandomGuy is voting Empking in the official reading but voting no one in my extractor. This seems correct though, with the mod being wrong/lazy.
