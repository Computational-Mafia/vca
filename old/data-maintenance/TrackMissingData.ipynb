    "# Track Missing Data\n",
    "We need a system for efficiently identifying missing data, with our initial population being the set of all completed Mini Normal games. We also want to identify _why_ a data point is missing and, when a data point is incomplete, what is present and what isn't. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What kinds of missing data are there?\n",
    "We can be missing setup/slot information, phase transition information, voting data, and/or thread content. And information can be missing because it hasn't been successfully extracted yet or because it's missing from the forum (e.g. because of a site crash). Also, rather than being present or missing, information can also instead be _inaccurate_ - but solving that problem requires an entirely different approach from that of detecting missing data, so we focus on it elsewhere. And finally, data can be undesirable - either because of a broken game (e.g. modflaking) or other issues that make inclusion in analysis difficult/unreasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How will we manage the prospect of missing data?\n",
    "We'll write a script that collects a list of existing completed game threads and checks our data set for associated data, building a list marking wherever data is missing. From there, we'll maintain this list, including updating it regularly as data collection ensues and new games finish, as well as manually marking instances where data collection is impossible or undesirable."
